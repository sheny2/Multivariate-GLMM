# Multivariate-GLMM

Tools for fitting multivariate mixed models in R (currently):

Multivariate LMMs (Gaussian): site-level random intercepts, optional shared random slopes across outcomes, exchangeable residual correlation across outcomes.

Multivariate GLMMs (Logistic): binary outcomes with site-level random intercepts (differ across outcomes).
